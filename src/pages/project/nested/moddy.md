During the quarantine and free time, I discovered [Discord](https://discord.com) and their API, that allows developers to create bots. When I heard this, I just wanted to start right after that. I went to github and created a repository and then started to look for tutorials. It was a really hard time, because I was really new and didn't know how to read documentations.

After a few youtube tutorials and blogs, I succeded to create my first hello world! I think, for all developers, their first running programming is alway the best momment. It is like *drugs*, I think... :DD

I created a moderation discord bot and gave it a name. I named it **Moddy**, it was a really stupid name. Moddy comes from moderation and a friendliness. After 3 months of learning the [discord.js](https://discord.js.org) library and learn more about Javascript language, I mastered the library :DD. During the development process, it caused many problems and errors. That is when I learned how to use Stackoverflow and Googling. I also learn how to run a server, learned about Linux server and networking.

After done with the bot, I went back to web development and created my first official website. It looks really terible, because I haven't used any frameworks.
