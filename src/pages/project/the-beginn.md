  Here I tell you the beginning of my programming career

Everything started since I had a chance to touch a smartphone! It was the best momment of my life, I was really curious, how the touch screen worked? In that momment, I just want to scramble it up and look at the parts inside them :D But yeah.. in that time, smartphones are really expensive and not everyone can afford a smartphone. So for our family, that smartphone is really importain. And that is how I found out, that I'm really interested at technologies!

Later, when I grew up. I went to a good school in Bulgaria and they had a subject, that teaches Computer Scientist! At the first time, I just felt in love to it! But I wasn't understanding anything that they taught me. I hated my self, I hated the reason that I couldn't understand. It was really hard to me, to read code, to understanding the syntax and etc. After a few months, pissed of of getting bad notes. I taught my self programming.

That is the momment, that had lead me to programming world. At first, I learned [HTML](https://html.com) and [CSS](https://csscrop.com), after a few week, I found out a great programming language [Javascript](https://javascript.com). It is a language that I still use until now! But I was a student, I had to prepare my self for school, I had to do homeworks and etc. I didn't have a lot of time for programming.

After a few year living in Bulgaria, I moved to Germany. I went to a normaler school, where they don't teach me hard things and things have gotten easier for me. So I started to code again and created some projects (look [github](https://github.com/CutieCat6778)).

I'm actually very happy, that I followed my hoppy and interest. I don't really know, if I have a talent for this, but I'm really confident at my self :D
