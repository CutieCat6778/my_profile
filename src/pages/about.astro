					Borned in Ha Tinh, Vietnam, in a poor, but growing country. I have learned how hard life in asian countries is, I learned how hard people had to work, to get their children best thing they have.
					Asian parent teaches their kids really strict, since I was a child, never had chance to touch a electronic! But I still managed to learn new things from
					olds device and sometime scramble them and look at the electronics inside them :D

					When the life have gotten better, I have moved to Europe, Bulgaria. Move to a another country, another culture. My eyes have opened really wide, I saw how the life
					in a modern europe country is. Their culture, the life and so more are really diffrent! The "slawen" language is really interesting for me. They are lovely people â™¥

					After a few years, we had a chance to move to eastern europe, where the economy are much better. We have moved to Germany and my eyes had to open wider, the people there,
					the culture and aspecially the economy. They live a very peaceful life, but our family doesn't. They had to work from early morning to late evening, just to have money and
					give me a good life. Our life standart have changed, we had a car and a beautiful house. Until now, I can't ask anything more :D
