      From Asia, proud of my home country Vietnam. I'm currently living in Germany, Europe and building my own life. I'm a self-taught programmer and started to code since I was in fifth grade. Working with computers has always been one of my favorite things to do since I was young. I still want to learn and improve my programming skills and prepare for my future.
